# Games
This is a repo that includes all the games that I have made using Python during my free time.
1. Chess: I hard-coded the entire game in Python, and I also included 2 basic rules, En Passant and Castling.
2. Tic-Tac_toe: This is the first game/project I made using Python. It is just a simple game of tic tac toe with all the rules.
